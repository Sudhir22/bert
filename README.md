# BERT-FUSED MODEL

This is a repository forked from googleresearch/bert. It contains modifications to use a BERT-Fused model for creating context aware neural machine translation.

The original repsitory can be found here : https://github.com/google-research/bert.

My inspiration of using bert fused model comes from https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.06823.pdf published earlier this year.
